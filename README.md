freerip allows you to quickly rip your own DVDs and CDs for personal use.  Simply, insert a disc into the drive and it will be ejected once complete.

This fork uses blkid within the jail to identify and handle multiple disk drives.

# Usage

   1. Insert a CD or DVD into the drive
   2. Wait
   3. The CD/DVD will be ejected once all the content has been copied.

# Building freerip.sh
To make development easier the freerip.sh script is generated by combining files in the src/ directory.  To build your own copy of freerip.sh for installation run ```make``` to create a directory (dist/) with files needed for installation.

# Installation

   1. Run ```make``` to gather all files needed for installation into dist/
   2. Install devd config and launcher on host, not in the jail

    sudo cp freerip.conf /etc/devd/
    sudo cp freerip-launcher /usr/local/bin/
   
   3. For me, /etc/devd/ was reset when rebooting FreeNAS, therefore I also copied freerip.conf to /conf/base/etc/
    
    sudo cp freerip.conf /conf/base/etc/devd/

   4. Restart devd to pickup new config

    sudo /etc/rc.d/devd restart

   5. Create a new jail called ```freerip```

   6. Configure storage to be mounted at ```/mnt/freerip```.  All rips will be saved here.

   7. Install freerip.sh into the jail

    sudo cp freerip.sh /mnt/jails/freerip/usr/local/bin

   8. Install HandbrakeCLI into the jail as per Ryan Baumann's excellent [guide](https://ryanfb.github.io/etc/2016/04/21/installing_handbrake_on_freenas.html)
   
   9. Install e2fsprogs into the jail to get blkid
   
    pkg install e2fsprogs

# Debugging

   1. disable devd

    sudo /etc/rc.d/devd stop

   2. Run devd in debug mode

    sudo devd -D -d

   3. Insert a new CD or DVD
